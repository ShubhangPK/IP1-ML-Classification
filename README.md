# ML-Classification
Combination of machine learning practices in a classification task can be experimented with.

The evaluation metric for this competition is Mean F1-Score. The F1 score, commonly used in information retrieval, measures accuracy using the statistics precision p and recall r. Precision is the ratio of true positives (tp) to all predicted positives (tp + fp). Recall is the ratio of true positives to all actual positives (tp + fn). The F1 score is given by: F1=2pr/(p+r).
